![Rocket Chat](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f9d4c7f5-3b1d-4e53-8fed-69975f5562ef)


This project aims to bring the core functionality of tools like Google Forms directly into Rocket.Chat, enabling teams to create, distribute, and analyze surveys or feedback without switching platforms. Similar to Google Forms, users will be able to generate forms within Rocket.Chat‚Äîcomplete with customizable fields and sharing options‚Äîbut with added capabilities like AI-powered form creation via natural language prompts. Real-time response notifications and automatic summary reports posted to designated channels ensure feedback loops stay active and visible, all within the chat workspace.
